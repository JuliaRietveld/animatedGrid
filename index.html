							<p>
								Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is 
								unhappy in its own way. 
								Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys’ house. 
								The wife had discovered that the husband was carrying on 
								an intrigue with a French girl, who had been a governess 
								in their family, and she had announced to her husband 
								that she could not go on living in the same house with 
								him. This position of affairs had now lasted three days, and 
								not only the husband and wif
								e themselves, but all the 
								members of their family and household, were painfully 
								conscious of it. Every person 
								in the house felt that there 
								was so sense in their living together, and that the stray 
								people brought together by chance in any inn had more in 
								common with one another than they, the members of the 
								family and household of the Oblonskys. The wife did not 
								leave her own room, the husband had not been at home 
								for three days. The children ran wild all over the house; 
								the English governess quarreled with the housekeeper, and 
								wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new 
								situation for her; the man-cook had walked off the day 
								before just at dinner time; the kitchen-maid, and the 
								coachman had given warning. 


								Three days after the quarrel, Prince Stepan 
								Arkadyevitch Oblonsky—Stiva, 
								as he was called in the 
								fashionable world— woke up at
								 his usual hour, that is, at 
								eight o’clock in the morning, not in his wife’s bedroom, 
								but on the leather-covered s
								ofa in his study. He turned 
								over his stout, well-cared-for person on the springy sofa, 
								as though he would sink into
								 a long sleep again; he 
								vigorously embraced the pillow on the other side and 
								buried his face in it; but all at once he jumped up, sat up 
								on the sofa, and opened his eyes. 
								‘Yes, yes, how was it now?’ he thought, going over his 
								dream. ‘Now, how was it? To be sure! Alabin was giving a 
								dinner at Darmstadt; no, not Darmstadt, but something 
								American. Yes, but then, Darmstadt was in America. Yes, 
								Alabin was giving a dinner on glass tables, and the tables 
								sang, Il mio tesoro—not Il mio tesoro though, but 
								something better, and there were some sort of little 
								decanters on the table, and th
								ey were women, too,’ he 
								remembered. 
								Stepan Arkadyevitch’s eyes twinkled gaily, and he 
								pondered with a smile. ‘Yes, it was nice, very nice. There 
								was a great deal more that wa
								s delightful, only there’s no 
								putting it into words, or even expressing it in one’s 
								thoughts awake.’

							<p> Stepan Arkadyevitch was a tr
							uthful man in his relations 
							with himself. He was incapable of deceiving himself and 
							persuading himself that he 
							repented of his conduct. He 
							could not at this date repent of the fact that he, a 
							handsome, susceptible man of thir
							ty-four, was not in love 
							with his wife, the mother of five living and two dead 
							children, and only a year younger than himself. All he 
							repented of was that he had not
							 succeeded better in hiding 
							it from his wife. But he felt a
							ll the difficulty of his position 
							and was sorry for his wife,
							 his children, and himself. 
							Possibly he might have managed 
							to conceal his sins better 
							from his wife if he had antic
							ipated that the knowledge of 
							them would have had such an effect on her. He had never 
							clearly thought out the subject, but he had vaguely 
							conceived that his wife must long ago have suspected him 
							of being unfaithful to her, and shut her eyes to the fact. 
							He had even supposed that
							 she, a worn-out woman no 
							longer young or good-looking, and in no way remarkable 
							or interesting, merely a good mother, ought from a sense 
							of fairness to take an indulgent view. It had turned out 
							quite the other way. </p>

							<p>When he was dressed, Stepan Arkadyevitch sprinkled 
							some scent on himself, pulled down his shirt-cuffs, 
							distributed into his pockets his cigarettes, pocketbook, 
							matches, and watch with its d
							ouble chain and seals, and 
							shaking out his handkerchief, feeling himself clean, 
							fragrant, healthy, and physically at ease, in spite of his 
							unhappiness, he walked with a slight swing on each leg 
							into the dining-room, where coffee was already waiting 
							for him, and beside the coffee,
							 letters and papers from the 
							office. 
							He read the letters. One wa
							s very unpleasant, from a 
							merchant who was buying a fo
							rest on his wife’s property. 
							To sell this forest was absolutely essential; but at present, 
							until he was reconciled with his wife, the subject could 
							not be discussed. The most unpleasant thing of all was that 
							his pecuniary interests should in this way enter into the 
							question of his reconciliation with his wife. And the idea 
							that he might be let on by his interests, that he might seek 
							a reconciliation with his wife on 
							account of the sale of the 
							forest—that idea hurt him. </p>

							<p>Darya Alexandrovna, in a dressing jacket, and with her

							with hairpins on the nape of her neck, with a sunken, thin

							the thinness of her face, was standing among a litter of all 
							sorts of things scattered all over the room, before an open 
							bureau, from which she was 
							taking something. Hearing

							<p>Stepan Arkadyevitch had learned easily at school, 
							thanks to his excellent abilitie
							s, but he had been idle and 
							mischievous, and therefore was one of the lowest in his 
							class. But in spite of his habit

							his inferior grade in the service, and his comparative 
							youth, he occupied the honora
							ble and lucrative position of 
							president of one of the government boards at Moscow. 
							This post he had received through his sister Anna’s 
							husband, Alexey Alexandrovitch Karenin, who held one 
							of the most important positions in the ministry to whose 
							department the Moscow office belonged. But if Karenin 
							had not got his brother- in-law this berth, then through a

							this post, or some other similar one, together with the 
							salary of six thousand absolutely needful for them, as his 
							affairs, in spite of his wife’s considerable property, were in 
							an embarrassed condition. 
							Half Moscow and Petersburg were friends and relations 
							of Stepan Arkadyevitch. He was born in the midst of those 
							who had been and are the powerful ones of this world. </p>
